## Reference scope

The Android checkout is used as a source reference only. The comparison includes:

- `app/src/main/java/com/lingion/sleepy/ui/component/**`
- `app/src/main/java/com/lingion/sleepy/ui/screen/**`
- `app/src/main/java/com/lingion/sleepy/ui/theme/**`
- `app/src/main/res/values/{colors.xml,themes.xml,strings.xml}`
- locale string resources and drawable resources referenced by the UI

No Android files are copied into the iOS repository. No Android checkout changes are part of the iOS implementation.

## Evidence limits

The local Android checkout before this baseline was a grafted shallow checkout with only a collector commit. The exact tag was recovered from the canonical `lingion/sleepy` repository through GitHub metadata and cloned into the separate checkout above. The comparison therefore uses the exact `v1.0.51` source, not the nearby `1.0.52` APK or visual guesses.
